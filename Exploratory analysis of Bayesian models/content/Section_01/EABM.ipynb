The inference process generates a posterior distribution - which has a central role in Bayesian statistics - together with other distributions like the posterior predictive distribution and the prior predictive distribution. The correct visualization, analysis, and interpretation of these distributions is key to properly answer the questions that motivate the inference process.\n",

    "> Exploratory data analysis (EDA) seeks to reveal structure, or simple descriptions in data. We look at numbers or graphs and try to find patterns. We pursue leads suggested by background information, imagination, patterns perceived, and experience with other data\n",

    "In the following sections we will discuss how to use ArviZ to perform Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models, together with a discussion of good practices for Bayesian modeling. As visualization plays a central role in Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models we begin our discussion with some general topics around visualization."
