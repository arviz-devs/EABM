    "text": "‎\nWhile conceptually simple, Bayesian methods can be mathematically and numerically challenging. Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) implement functions to easily build Bayesian models together with efficient automatic inference methods. This helps separate the model building from the inference, allowing practitioners to focus on their specific problems and leaving the PPLs to handle the computational details for them (Bessiere et al. 2013; Daniel Roy 2015; Ghahramani 2015). The inference process generates a posterior distribution - which has a central role in Bayesian statistics - together with other distributions like the posterior predictive distribution and the prior predictive distribution. The correct visualization, analysis, and interpretation of these distributions is key to properly answer the questions that motivated the inference process.\nWhen working with Bayesian models there are a series of related tasks that need to be addressed besides inference itself:\n\nDiagnoses of the quality of the inference (as this is generally done using numerical approximation methods)\nModel criticism, including evaluations of both model assumptions and model predictions\nComparison of models, including model selection or model averaging\nPreparation of the results for a particular audience\n\nWe collectivelly call all these tasks Exploratory analysis of Bayesian model, as we take many ideas from Exploratory data analysis and apply them to analyze Bayesian modesl.\nIn the words of Persi Diaconis (Diaconis 2011):\n\n“Exploratory data analysis seeks to reveal structure, or simple descriptions in data. We look at numbers or graphs and try to find patterns. We pursue leads suggested by background information, imagination, patterns perceived, and experience with other data analyses”.\n\nIn this book we will discuss how to use both numerical and visual summaries to help successfully performing such tasks that are central to the iterative and interactive modeling process. To do so, we first discuss some general principles of data visualization and uncertainty representation that are not exclusibe of Bayesian statistics.\n\n\n\n\nBessiere, Pierre, Emmanuel Mazer, Juan Manuel Ahuactzin, and Kamel Mekhnacha. 2013.

    "text": "1.1 Coordinate systems and axes\nData visualization requires defining position scales to determine where different data values are located in a graphic. In 2D visualizations, two numbers are required to uniquely specify a point. Thus, we need two position scales. The arrangement of these scales is known as a coordinate system. The most common coordinate system is the 2D Cartesian system, using x and y values with orthogonal axes. Conventionally with the x-axis running horizontally and the y-axis vertically. Figure 1.1 shows a Cartesian coordinate system.\nIn practice, we typically shift the axes so that they do not necessarily pass through the origin (0,0), and instead their location is determined by the data. We do this because it is usually more convenient and easier to read to have the axes to the left and bottom of the figure than in the middle. For instance Figure 1.2 plots the exact same points shown in Figure 1.1 but with the axes placed automatically by matplotlib.\nUsually, data has units, such as degrees Celsius for temperature, centimeters for length, or kilograms for weight. In case we are plotting variables of different types (and hence different units) we can adjust the aspect ratio of the axes as we wish. We can make a figure short and wide if it fits better on a page or screen. But we can also change the aspect ratio to highlight important differences, for example, if we want to emphasize changes along the y-axis we can make the figure tall and narrow. When both the x and y axes use the same units, it’s important to maintain an equal ratio to ensure that the relationship between data points on the graph accurately reflects their quantitative values.\nAfter the cartesian coordinate system, the most common coordinate system is the polar coordinate system. In this system, the position of a point is determined by the distance from the origin and the angle with respect to a reference axis. Polar coordinates are useful for representing periodic data, such as days of the week, or data that is naturally represented in a circular shape, such as wind direction. Figure Figure 1.3 shows a polar coordinate system.",

In addition, we can add text to the plot to provide additional information.\nArviZ uses both matplotlib and bokeh as plotting backends. While for basic use of ArviZ is not necessary to know about these libraries, being familiar with them is useful to better understand some of the arguments in ArviZ’s plots and/or to tweak the default plots generated with ArviZ.

    "text": "1.3 Good practices and sources of error\nUsing visualization to deceive third parties should not be the goal of an intellectually honest person, and you must also be careful not to deceive yourself. For example, it has been known for decades that a bar chart is more effective for comparing values than a pie chart. The reason is that our perceptual apparatus is quite good at evaluating lengths, but not very good at evaluating areas. Figure 1.4 shows different visual elements ordered according to the precision with which the human brain can detect differences and make comparisons between them (Cleveland and McGill 1984; Heer and Bostock 2010).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Scale of elementary perceptual tasks, taken from The Truthful Art\n\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General principles for using colors\nHuman eyes work by essentially perceiving 3 wavelengths, this feature is used in technological devices such as screens to generate all colors from combinations of 3 components, Red, Green, and Blue. This is known as the RGB color model. But this is not the only possible system. A very common alternative is the CYMK color model, Cyan, Yellow, Magenta, and Black.\nTo analyze the perceptual attributes of color, it is better to think in terms of Hue, Saturation, and Lightness, HSL is an alternative representation of the RGB color model.\nThe hue is what we colloquially call “different colors”. Green, red, etc. Saturation is how colorful or washed out we perceive a given color. Two colors with different hues will look more different when they have more saturation. The lightness corresponds to the amount of light emitted (active screens) or reflected (impressions), ranging from black to white:\nVarying the tone is useful to easily distinguish categories as shown in Figure 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Tone varitaions can be help to distinguish categories.\n\n\n\nIn principle, most humans are capable of distinguishing millions of tones, but if we want to associate categories with colors, the effectiveness of distinguishing them decreases drastically as the number of categories increases. This happens not only because the tones will be increasingly closer to each other, but also because we have a limited working memory. Associating a few colors (say 4) with categories (countries, temperature ranges, etc.) is usually easy. But unless there are pre-existing associations, remembering many categories becomes challenging and this exacerbates when colors are close to each other. This requires us to continually alternate between the graphic and the legend or text where the color-category association is indicated. Adding other elements besides color such as shapes can help, but in general, it will be more useful to try to keep the number of categories relatively low. In addition, it is important to take into account the presentation context, if we want to show a figure during a presentation where we only have a few seconds to dedicate to that figure, it is advisable to keep the figure as simple as possible. This may involve removing items and displaying only a subset of the data. If the figure is part of a text, where the reader will have the time to analyze for a longer period, perhaps the complexity can be somewhat greater.\nAlthough we mentioned before that human eyes are capable of distinguishing three main colors (red, green, and blue), the ability to distinguish these 3 colors varies between people, to the point that many individuals have difficulty distinguishing some colors. The most common case occurs with red and green. This is why it is important to avoid using those colors. An easy way to avoid this problem is to use colorblind-friendly palettes. We’ll see later that this is an easy thing to do when using ArviZ.\nVarying the lightness as in Figure 1.6 is useful when we want to represent a continuous scale. With the hue-based palette (left), it’s quite difficult to determine that our data shows two “spikes”, whereas this is easier to see with the lightness-modifying palette (right). Varying the lightness helps to see the structure of the data since changes in lightness are more intuitively processed as quantitative changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Hue-based palette (left) vs lightness-modifying palette (right)\n\n\n\nOne detail that we should note is that the graph on the right of Figure 1.6 does not change only the lightness, it is not a map in gray or blue scales. That palette also changes the hue but in a very subtle way. This makes it aesthetically more pleasing and the subtle variation in hue contributes to increasing the perceptual distance between two values and therefore the ability to distinguish small differences.\nWhen using colors to represent numerical variables it is important to use uniformly perceptual maps like those offered by matplotlib or colorcet. These are maps where the colors vary in such a way that they adequately reflect changes in the data. Not all colormaps are perceptually uniform. Obtaining them is not trivial. Figure 1.7 shows the same image using different colormaps. We can see that widely used maps such as jet (also called rainbow) generate distortions in the image. In contrast viridis, a perceptually uniform color map does not generate such distortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: non-uniformly perceptual maps like jet can be very missleading\n\n\n\nA common criticism of perceptually smooth maps is that they appear more “flat” or “boring” at first glance. And instead maps like Jet, show greater contrast. But that is precisely one of the problems with maps like Jet, the magnitude of these contrasts does not correlate with changes in the data, so even extremes can occur, such as showing contrasts that are not there and hiding differences that are truly there.",

This palette was designed using colorcyclepicker. arviz-doc, the style used in ArviZ documentation, uses another color-blind friendly and it looks gorgeous on-screen and in printed documents, although it can be tricky for projections if the room is not dark enough.\nIf you need to do plots in grey-scale we recommend restricting yourself to the first 3 colors of the ArviZ default palette (“C0”, “C1” and “C2”), otherwise, you may need to use different line styles or different markers. Another useful palette when the number of colors is restricted is the grayscale which assigns greys to the first four colors (“C0”, “C1”, “C2” and “C3”) and the ArviZ’s blue to “C5”.

    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1 InferenceData\nDuring a modern Bayesian analysis we usually generate many sets of data including posterior samples and posterior predictive samples. But we also have observed data, and statistics generated by the sampling method, samples from the prior and/or prior predictive distribution, etc. All this data can be stored in an InferenceData object, to keep them tidy and avoid confusion each one of these sets it is assigned to a different group. For instance, the posterior samples are stored in the posterior group. The observed data is stored in the observed_data group and so on. InferenceData is based on xarray . If you are not familiar with xarray imagine NumPy multidimensional arrays but with labels! This makes many operations easier as you don’t have to remember the order of the dimensions. Each group in an InferenceData is a DataSet and Datasets are dictionary-like containers of DataArrays. You can read more about the terminology used in xarray here\nThe best way to understand InferenceData is to explore it.

This is an HTML representation of the InferenceData, so if you are reading this from a browser you should be able to interact with it. If you click on the posterior group you will see that we have three dimensions, with the names chain, draw, and school, you can think of dimensions as the axes of a plot. This means that the posterior samples were generated by running an MCMC sampler with 4 chains, each one of 500 draws. At least for one of the parameters in the posterior we have and additional dimension called school. If you click on coordinates you will be able to see the actual values that each dimension can take, like the integers [0, 1, 2, 3] for chain and the strings ['Choate', 'Deerfield', 'Phillips Andover', 'Phillips Exeter', 'Hotchkiss', 'Lawrenceville', \"St. Paul's\", 'Mt. Hermon'] for school, notice that we have an array of dtype=object. Furthermore, if you click on the  symbol by the school coordinate, you will be able to see the names of each school.",

But extract can be more flexible because it takes care of the most common subsetting operations with MCMC samples. It can:\n\nCombine chains and draws\nReturn a subset of variables (with optional filtering with regular expressions or string matching)\nReturn a subset of samples. Moreover, by default, it returns a random subset to prevent getting non-representative samples due to bad mixing.\nAccess any group\n\nTo get a subsample we can specify the number of samples we want with the num_samples argument. For instance, to get 100 samples we can write:\n\naz.extract(idata, num_samples=100);\n\nIf you need to extract subsets from multiple groups, you should use a random seed. This will ensure that subsamples match. For example, if you do\n\nposterior = az.extract(idata, num_samples=100, rng=124)\nll = az.extract(idata, group=\"log_likelihood\", num_samples=100, rng=124)\n\nYou can inspect the samples in the posterior and ll variables and see that they match.",

    "text": "2.4 Advance operations with InferenceData\nNow we delve into more advanced operations with InferenceData. While these operations are not essential to use ArviZ, they can be useful in some cases. Exploring these advanced functionalities will help you become more familiar with InferenceData and provide additional insights that may enhance your overall experience with ArviZ.\n\n2.4.1 Compute and store posterior pushforward quantities\nWe use “posterior pushforward quantities” to refer to quantities that are not variables in the posterior but deterministic computations using posterior variables.\nYou can use xarray for these pushforward operations and store them as a new variable in the posterior group. You’ll then be able to plot them with ArviZ functions, calculate stats and diagnostics on them (like mcse), or save and share the InferenceData object with the pushforward quantities included.\nThe first thing we are going to do is to store the posterior group in a variable called post to make the code more readable. And to compute the log of \\(\\tau\\).\n\npost = idata.posterior\npost[\"log_tau\"] = np.log(post[\"tau\"])\n\nCompute the rolling mean of \\(\\log(\\tau)\\) with xarray.DataArray.rolling, storing the result in the posterior:\n\npost[\"mlogtau\"] = post[\"log_tau\"].rolling({\"draw\": 50}).mean()\n\nUsing xarray for pushforward calculations has all the advantages of working with xarray. It also inherits the disadvantages of working with xarray, but we believe those to be outweighed by the advantages, and we have already shown how to extract the data as NumPy arrays. Working with InferenceData is working mainly with xarray objects and this is what is shown in this guide.\nSome examples of these advantages are specifying operations with named dimensions instead of positional ones (as seen in some previous sections), automatic alignment and broadcasting of arrays (as we’ll see now), or integration with Dask (as shown in the dask_for_arviz guide).\nIn this cell, you will compute pairwise differences between schools on their mean effects (variable theta). To do so, subtract the variable theta after renaming the school dimension to the original variable. Xarray then aligns and broadcasts the two variables because they have different dimensions, and the result is a 4D variable with all the pointwise differences.\nEventually, store the result in the theta_school_diff variable. Notice that the theta_shool_diff variable in the posterior has kept the named dimensions and coordinates:\n\npost[\"theta_school_diff\"] = post.theta - post.theta.rename(school=\"school_bis\")\npost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.Dataset&gt; Size: 1MB\nDimensions:            (chain: 4, draw: 500, school: 8, school_bis: 8)\nCoordinates:\n  * chain              (chain) int64 32B 0 1 2 3\n  * draw               (draw) int64 4kB 0 1 2 3 4 5 ... 494 495 496 497 498 499\n  * school             (school) &lt;U16 512B 'Choate' 'Deerfield' ...

    "text": "3.1 Random variables\nFrom a Bayesian perspective probabilities represent a degree of (un)certainty about the occurrence of an event. It is a measure of the likelihood that a particular hypothesis or event is true, given the available data and prior knowledge. We assign the value 0 to something impossible and 1 to something certain. When we are unsure we assign a value in between. For example, we could say that the probability of rain tomorrow is 0.32. This means that we are 32% certain that it will rain tomorrow.\nIn practice we usually do not care about individual probabilities, instead we work with probability distributions. A probability distribution describes the probabilities associated with each possible outcome of an experiment. In statistics, the term “experiment” is used in a very wide sense. It could mean a well-planned experiment in a laboratory, but it could also mean the result of a poll, the observation of the weather tomorrow, or the number of people that will visit a website next week.\nLet’s consider the experiment of observing the weather tomorrow. The possible outcomes of this experiment include the following outcomes:\nNotice that we are omitting the possibility of snow, or hail. In other words, we are assigning 0 probability to those outcomes. It is usually the case that we do not ponder all the possible outcomes of an experiment, either because we deliberately assume them to be irrelevant, because we don’t know about them, or because is too complex/expensive/time-consuming/etc to take them all into account.\nAnother important thing to notice, from this example, is that these outcomes are words (or strings if you want). To work with them we need to assign a number to each outcome. For example, we could assign the numbers 0 to Rainy, 1 to Sunny, and 2 to Cloudy. This mapping from the outcomes to the numbers is called a random variable. This is a funny and potentially misleading name as its mathematical definition is not random (the mapping is deterministic) nor a variable (it is a function). The mapping is arbitrary, -1 to Rainy, 0 to Sunny, and 4 to Cloudy is also valid. But once we pick one mapping, we keep using it for the rest of the experiment or analysis. One common source of confusion is understanding where the randomness comes from if the mapping is deterministic. The randomness comes from the uncertainty about the outcome of the experiment, i.e. the weather tomorrow. We are not sure if it will be rainy tomorrow until tomorrow comes.\nRandom variables can be classified into two main types: discrete and continuous.",

No intermediate values are allowed in our experiment, even when it is true that it can be partially sunny and still rain. And it has to be at least partially cloudy to rain. But we are not considering those possibilities.\nContinuous Random Variables: They can take on any value within a certain range. For example, the temperature tomorrow is a continuous random variable. If we use a Celcius scale, then it can take on any value between -273.15 Celsius to \\(+ \\infty\\). Of course, in practice, the expected temperature is restricted to a much narrower range. The lowest recorded temperature on Earth is −89.2 °C and the highest is 56.7 °C, and that range will be even narrower if we consider a particular region of our planet.",

For instance, the following plot shows the probability mass function of a categorical distribution with three possible outcomes, like Rainy, Sunny, and Cloudy.\n\npz.Categorical([0.15, 0.6, 0.25]).plot_pdf();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: PMF of a Categorical disribution\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually, there is more than one probability distribution that we can use to represent the same set of probabilities, for instance, we could use a binomial distribution.\n\npz.Binomial(2, 0.6).plot_pdf();\n\nBinomial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: PMF of a Binomial distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability distribution of a continuous random variable is described using a probability density function (PDF), which specifies the likelihood of the random variable falling within a particular interval. For instance, we could use a normal distribution to describe the temperature tomorrow.\n\npz.Normal(30, 4).plot_pdf();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: PDF of a normal distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nor maybe a skew normal like this if we expect higher temperatures like during summer.\n\npz.SkewNormal(38, 5, -2).plot_pdf();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: PDF of a skew-normal distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice that we use plot_pdf() instead of plot_pmf(), this is because PreliZ uses the same method to plot both discrete and continuous distributions. In the case of discrete distributions, it will plot the probability mass function (PMF), and in the case of continuous distributions, it will plot the probability density function (PDF).\n\n\nOne issue when interpreting a PDF is that the y-axis is a density, not a probability. To get probability from a PDF we need to integrate the density over a given interval. This is something straightforward to do with a computer. But not that easy to do “visually”, human eyes/brains are not very good at that task. One way to alleviate this issue is to accompany a PDF with a point interval, like in the following plot.\n\npz.SkewNormal(38, 5, -2).plot_pdf(pointinterval=True);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: PDF of a SkewNormal distribution with a pointinterval\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point interval shows the quantiles of the distribution. Quantiles divide a dataset into equal probability intervals. For example, deciles divide a dataset into 10 equal-probability intervals, and quartiles divide a dataset into 4 equal-probability intervals. The most common quantile is the median (or 50th percentile), which divides a dataset into two equal-probability intervals where half of the data falls below the median and half of the data falls above the median.\nThe point interval in Figure 3.5 shows the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles. The point is the median. The tick line is the interquartile range (the central 50% of the distribution) and the thin line is the central 90% of the distribution.",

But there are other ways to represent a distribution. For example, we could use the cumulative distribution function (CDF).\nThe CDF is defined as the probability that the random variable takes a value less than or equal to \\(x\\). The CDF is defined for both discrete and continuous random variables. Figure 3.6 shows the CDF of a categorical distribution with three possible outcomes.

Instead for a CDF the y-axis is a probability. For the PMF/PDF it is easier to get the mode (the highest value for the point/curve), and for the CDF it is easier to get the median (the value of \\(x\\) for which \\(y=0.5\\)), or other quantiles. From the CDF it is also easier to quickly get quantities like the probability of getting a temperature equal or lower than 35 degrees. It is the value of the CDF at 35. From Figure 3.7 we can see that it is roughly 0.9 or 90%, if you want more accuracy you could use a matplotlib/ArviZ style with a grid (like arviz-darkgrid) or use the cdf() function.\n\npz.Normal(30, 4).cdf(35)\n\n0.894350157794624\n\n\nFrom the CDF we can also easily get the probability of a range of values.

Again even when you can get a good estimate just by looking at the graph you can use the cdf() function to get a more accurate estimate.

    "section": "3.5 Distributions in ArviZ",
    "text": "3.5 Distributions in ArviZ\nThe PMF/PDF, CDF, and PPF are convenient ways to represent distributions for which we know the analytical form. But in practice, we often work with distributions that we don’t know their analytical form. Instead, we have a set of samples from the distribution. A clear example is a posterior distribution, computed using an MCMC method. For those cases, we still want useful visualization that we can use for ourselves or to show others. Some common methods are:\n\nHistograms\nKernel density estimation (KDE)\nEmpirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF)\nQuantile dot plots\n\nWe will discuss these methods in the next subsections with special emphasis on how they are implemented in ArviZ.\n\n3.5.1 Histograms\nHistograms are a very simple and effective way to represent a distribution. The basic idea is to divide the range of the data into a set of bins and count how many data points fall into each bin. Then we use as many bars as bins, with the height of the bars being proportional to the counts. The following video shows a step-by-step animation of a histogram being built.\nVideo\nHistograms can be used to represent both discrete and continuous random variables. Discrete variables are usually represented using integers. When ArviZ is asked to plot integer data it will use histograms as the default method. Arguably the most important parameter of a histogram is the number of bins. Too few bins and we will miss details, too many and we will plot noise. You can pick the number of bins with a bit of trial and error, especially when you are sure of what you want to show. However, there are many methods to compute the number of bins automatically from the data, like the Freedman–Diaconis rule or the Sturges’ rule. By default, ArviZ computes the number of bins using both rules and then picks the one that gives the largest number of bins. This is the same approach used by np.histogram(., bins=\"auto) and plt.hist(., bins=\"auto). Additionally, when the data is of type integers, ArviZ will preserve that structure and will associate bins to integers, instead of floats. If the number of unique integers is relatively small then, it will associate one bin to each integer. For example, in the following plot each bar is associated with an integer in the interval [0, 9].\n\nd_values = pz.Poisson(3).rvs(500)\naz.plot_dist(d_values);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Histogram from a sample of integers. Each bin corresponds to a single integer.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the discrete values take higher values, like in Figure 3.11, bins are still associated with integers but many integers are binned together.\n\nd_values = pz.Poisson(100).rvs(500)\naz.plot_dist(d_values);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: Histogram from a sample of integers. Bins group together many integers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t like the default binning criteria of ArviZ, you can change it by passing the bins argument using the hist_kwargs.\n\nd_values = pz.Poisson(100).rvs(500)\nax = az.plot_dist(d_values, hist_kwargs={\"bins\":\"auto\"})\nplt.setp(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.12: Histogram from a sample of integers, with bins automatically computed by Matplotlib, not ArviZ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 KDE\nKernel density estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function from a sample. Intuitivelly you can think of it as the smooth version of a histogram. Conceptually you place a kernel function like a Gaussian on top of a data point, then you sum all the Gaussians, generally evaluated over a grid and not over the data points. Results are normalized so the total area under the curve is one. The following video shows a step-by-step animation of a KDE being built. You can see a version with border corrections and without them. Border corrections avoid adding a positive density outside the range of the data.\nVideo\nThe following block of code shows a very simple example of a KDE.\n\n_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 4))\nbandwidth = 0.4\nnp.random.seed(19)\ndatapoints = 7\ny = np.random.normal(7, size=datapoints)\nx = np.linspace(y.min() - bandwidth * 3, y.max() + bandwidth * 3, 100)\nkernels = np.transpose([pz.Normal(i, bandwidth).pdf(x) for i in y])\nkernels *= 1/datapoints  # normalize the results\nax.plot(x, kernels, 'k--', alpha=0.5)\nax.plot(y, np.zeros(len(y)), 'C1o')\nax.plot(x, kernels.sum(1))\nax.set_xticks([])\nax.set_yticks([]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most important parameter of a KDE is the bandwidth which controls the degree of smoothness of the resulting curve. It is analogous to the number of bins for the histograms. ArviZ’s default method to compute the bandwidth works well for a wide range of distributions including multimodal ones. Compared to other KDEs in the Python ecosystem, the KDE implemented in ArviZ automatically handles the boundaries of a distribution. ArviZ will assign a density of zero to any point outside the range of the data.\nThe following example shows a KDE computed from a sample from a Gamma distribution. Notice that ArviZ computes a KDE instead of a histogram, and notice that there is no density for negative values.\n\nc_values = pz.Gamma(2, 3).rvs(1000)\naz.plot_dist(c_values);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.13: KDE from a sample of floats. By default, ArviZ computes a KDE instead of a histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 ECDF\nBoth histograms and KDEs are ways to approximate the PMF/PDF of a distribution from a sample. But sometimes we may want to approximate the CDF instead. The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is a non-parametric way to estimate the CDF. It is a step function that jumps up by 1/N at each observed data point, where N is the total number of data points. The following video shows a step-by-step animation of an ECDF being built.\nVideo\nThe following block of code shows a very simple example of an ECDF.\n\nc_values = pz.Poisson(3).rvs(500)\naz.plot_ecdf(c_values);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.14: empirical cumulative distribution function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Quantile dot plots\nA quantile dot plot displays the distribution of a sample in terms of its quantiles. Reading the median or other quantiles from quantile dot plots is generally easy, we just need to count the number of dots.\nThe folowing video shows a step-by-step animation of a quantile dot plot being built.\nVideo\nFrom Figure 3.15 we can easily see that 30% of the data is below 2. We do this by noticing that we have a total of 10 dots and 3 of them are below 2.\n\nc_values = pz.Poisson(2.4).rvs(500)\naz.plot_dot(c_values, nquantiles=10);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.15: Quantile dot plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of quantiles (nquantiles) is something you will need to choose by yourself, usually, it is a good idea to keep this number relatively small and “round”, as the main feature of a quantile dot plot is that finding probability intervals reduces to counting dots. It is easier to count and compute proportion if you have 10, or 20 dots than if you have 11 or 57. But sometimes a larger number could be a good idea too, for instance, if you or your audience wants to focus on the tails of the distribution a larger number of dots will give you more resolution and you still will be counting only a rather small number dots so it will be easy to compute proportions.",

The logic is that by comparing independent runs we can more easily sport issues than running a single instance. This multiple-chain approach also takes advantage of modern hardware.

    "text": "4.2 Trace plots\nA trace plot is created by drawing the sampled values at each iteration step. Ideally, we should expect to see a very noisy plot, some people call it a caterpillar. The reason is that draws should be uncorrelated from each other, the value of a draw should not provide any hint about the previous or next draw. Also, the draws from the first iterations should be indistinguishable from the ones coming from the last iterations the middle iterations, or any other region. The ideal scenario is the lack of any clear pattern as we can see at the right panel of Figure 4.1.\nIn ArviZ by calling the function az.plot_trace(.) we get a trace plot on the right and on the left a KDE (for continuous variables) or a histogram (for discrete variables). Figure 4.1 is an example of this. The KDE/histogram can help to spot differences between chains, ideally, distributions should overlap.\n\naz.plot_trace(sample, var_names=\"good_sample\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Trace plot of a sample without issues\n\n\n\n\n\nThis represents a scenario where the sampler is visiting two different regions of the parameter space and is not able to jump from one to the other. Additionally, it is also moving very slowly within each region. Figure 4.2 shows two problems. On the one hand, each chain is visiting a different region of the parameter space. We can see this from the trace plot itself and the KDE. On the other hand, even within each region, the sampler is having trouble properly exploring the space, notice how it keeps moving up, instead of being stationary.\n\n\nCode\naz.plot_trace(sample, var_names=\"bad_sample_0\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Trace plot of two chains that has not converged\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally from Figure 4.3, we can see another common scenario. This time we see that globally everything looks fine. But there are 3 regions where the sampler gets stuck, see the orange lines at the bottom of the traceplot. For the first two regions, starting at iterations 736 and 916, both chains got stuck. For the third region, starting in 1463, only one chain got stuck.\n\n\nCode\naxes = az.plot_trace(sample, var_names=\"bad_sample_1\")\nfor pos in [736, 916, 1463]:\n    axes[0, 1].plot((pos, pos+100), (0, 0), \"C2\", lw=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Trace plot showing a sampler being stuck in some regions (see orange lines)\n\n\n\n\n\nTrace plots are probably the first plots we make after inference and also probably the most popular plots in Bayesian literature.

Then we regroup the rankings according to the chains that gave rise to them and for each chain we make a histogram. If the chains were indistinguishable we would expect the histograms to be uniform. Since there is no reason for one chain to have more low (or medium or high) rankings than the rest.\nFigure 4.4 shows rank plots for good_sample, bad_sample_0 and bad_sample_1.

Figure 4.5 can help us develop intuition. In this figure, we analyze the error incurred while computing an estimate (such as the mean) from samples of different size, considering varying degrees of autocorrelation. The results represent averages from 1000 repetitions.\nWe can see that the error goes down as the sample size increases and we can also see that the lower the autocorrelation the smaller the sample size to achieve an estimate with a given error.

It is recommended the ESS to be greater than 100 per chain. That is, for 4 chains we want a minimum of 400 effective samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe ESS can also be used as a metric of the efficiency of MCMC sampling methods. For instance, we may want to measure the ESS per sample (ESS/n), a sampler that generates a ESS/n closer to 1 is more efficient than a sampler that generates values closer to 0. Other common metrics are the ESS per second, and the ESS per likelihood evaluation.\n\n\nWe see that az.summary(⋅) returns two ESS values, ess_bulk and ess_tail. This is because different regions of the parameter space may have different ESS values since not all regions are sampled with the same efficiency. Intuitively, one may think that when sampling a distribution like a Gaussian it is easier to obtain better sample quality around the mean than around the tails, simply because we have more samples from that region. For some models, it could be the other way around, but the take-home message remains, not all regions are necessarily sampled with the same efficiency\n\naz.summary(sample, kind=\"diagnostics\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\nbad_sample_0\n0.185\n0.150\n2.0\n11.0\n2.66\n\n\nbad_sample_1\n0.019\n0.014\n291.0\n3399.0\n1.01\n\n\ngood_sample\n0.005\n0.003\n3799.0\n3925.0\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we are going to use the MCMC samples to calculate central values such as means or medians then we have to make sure that the ess_bulk is sufficiently large, however, if we want to calculate intervals such as an HDI 94% we have to make sure that ess_tail be appropriate.\nArviZ offers several functions linked to the ESS. For example, if we want to evaluate the performance of the sampler for several regions at the same time we can use az.plot_ess.\n\n_, ax = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(10, 8))\naz.plot_ess(sample, ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple way to increase the ESS is to increase the number of samples, but it could be the case that the ESS grows very slowly with the number of samples, so even if we increased the number of samples 10 times we could still be very far from our target value. One way to estimate “how many more samples do we need” is to use az.plot_ess(⋅, kind=\"evolution\"). This graph shows us how the ESS changed with each iteration, which allows us to make predictions.\nFrom Figure 4.7 we can see that the ESS grows linearly with the number of samples for good_sample, and it does not grow at all for bad_sample_0. In the latter case, this is an indication that there is virtually no hope of improving the ESS simply by increasing the number of draws.\n\n_, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1) \naz.plot_ess(sample, var_names=[\"good_sample\", \"bad_sample_0\"], kind=\"evolution\", ax=axes);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: ESS evolution plot for good_sample and bad_sample_0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE)\nAn advantage of the ESS is that it is scale-free, it does not matter if one parameter varies between 0.1 and 0.2 and another between -2000 and 0, an ESS of 400 has the same meaning for both parameters. In models with many parameters, we can quickly identify which parameters are most problematic. However, when reporting results it is not very informative to know whether the ESS was 1372 or 1501. Instead, we would like to know the order of the errors we are making when approximating the posterior. This information is given by the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE). Like the ESS, the MCSE takes into account the autocorrelation of the samples. This error should be below the desired precision in our results. That is, if for a parameter the MCSE is 0.1, it does not make sense to report that the mean of that parameter is 3.15. Since the correct value could easily be between 3.4 and 2.8.\nWith ArviZ we can get the MCSE with az.mcse(⋅) or az.summary(⋅).\n\naz.mcse(sample)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.Dataset&gt; Size: 24B\nDimensions:       ()\nData variables:\n    bad_sample_0  float64 8B 0.1846\n    bad_sample_1  float64 8B 0.01907\n    good_sample   float64 8B 0.004618xarray.DatasetDimensions:Coordinates: (0)Data variables: (3)bad_sample_0()float640.1846array(0.18461169)bad_sample_1()float640.01907array(0.0190719)good_sample()float640.004618array(0.00461769)Indexes: (0)Attributes: (0)",

These tests are generally very sensitive.\nTo exemplify this we are going to load two InferenceData from pre-calculated models. The details of how these data were generated are not relevant at the moment. We will only say that they are two models that are mathematically equivalent but parameterized in different ways. In this case, the parameterization affects the efficiency of the sampler.

This happens, for example, when trying to go from regions of low curvature to regions of high curvature. In these cases, the numerical trajectories may diverge. Essentially this happens because in these cases there is no single set of hyper-parameters that allows efficient sampling of both regions. So one region is sampled properly and when the sampler moves to the other region it fails. Divergent numerical trajectories are extremely sensitive identifiers of pathological neighborhoods.\nThe following example shows two things the non-centered model shows several divergences (turquoise circles) grouped in one region. In the centered model, which has no divergence, you can see that around that same region, there are samples for smaller values of tau.

In that case, we can think about improving the model, one way to improve it is to use prior knowledge to improve the priors.\n\nSome models can be expressed in more than one way, all mathematically equivalent. In those cases, some parameterizations may be more efficient than others. For example, as we will see later with hierarchical linear models.\nIn the case of divergences, these are usually eliminated by increasing the acceptance rate, for instance in PyMC you can do pm.sample(..., target_accept=x) where x is 0.8 by default and the maximum value is 1. If you reach 0.99 you should probably do something else.\nModern probabilistic programming languages, usually provide useful warning messages and tips if they detect issues with sampling, paying attention to those messages can save you a lot of time.",

    "text": "5.1 Prior predictive checks\nThe general algorithm for prior predictive checks is:\nNotice that in step 4 we use domain knowledge, NOT observed data!\nTo exemplify this, let’s try with a super simple example. We want to model the height of a person. We know that the height of a person is a positive number, so we can use a half-normal distribution as a prior. We also know that the height of a person is not 100 meters, so we can use a half-normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 10.\nIn the following block of code, we define such a model and draw 500 samples from the prior predictive distribution.\nIn the following plot, we can see samples from the prior predictive distribution (blue solid lines). If we aggregate all the individual samples into a single large sample we get the dashed cyan line. To help us interpret this plot we have added two reference lines, the average length/height of a newborn and the average (male) adult height. These references are approximate values, but they are useful to provide a sense of the scale of the expected data. We can see that our model is bananas, not only heights can be negative, but the bulk of the prior predictive distribution is outside of our reference values.\nax = az.plot_ppc(idata, group=\"prior\")\nax.axvline(50, color=\"0.5\", linestyle=\":\", label=\"newborn\")\nax.axvline(175, color=\"0.5\", linestyle=\"--\", label=\"adult\")\nplt.legend()\nWe can tighten up the priors. There is no general rule to do this. For most problems, we do not want, we can not, or is too expensive to set very informative priors. So for most problems, it is usually a better idea to set priors using some broad domain knowledge in such a way that we we get a relatively reasonable prior predictive distribution. These priors are called weakly informative priors, they usually avoid unreasonable value or put too little mass in some regions of the parameter space. For instance, we can use a normal distribution with a mean of 175 and a standard deviation of 10. This distribution doesn’t exclude negative values, but it assigns very little mass to them. Also is broad enough to allow for a wide range of values.\nWe repeat the previous plot with the new prior predictive distribution. We can see that the bulk of the prior predictive distribution is now within the reference values. The model predicts values above 200 cm and below 150 cm, which are indeed possible but are less likely. You are to pick other priors and other reference values. Maybe you can use the values for the taller and shorter person in the world as reference values.\nax = az.plot_ppc(idata, group=\"prior\")\nax.axvline(50, color=\"0.5\", linestyle=\":\", label=\"newborn\")\nax.axvline(175, color=\"0.5\", linestyle=\"--\", label=\"adult\")\nplt.legend()\nWe recommend weakly informative priors instead of informative priors because usually we do not have enough information to set very informative priors or that process can be very time-consuming. And we recommend weakly informative priors instead of very vague priors because adding some prior information is usually better than adding none and for some problems, it can be not that difficult. The more data we have the less impact the priors will have on the posterior, but still usually there is some gain in avoiding non-sensical values and starting from more taught priors. Even sometimes sampling is more efficient when we avoid very vague priors. Also very importantly, even if the priors have little effect doing prior predictive checks and playing with piors can help us to understand the model and the problem better.\nIf you want to learn more about prior elicitation you can check the PreliZ library.\nOne final note. When plotting many distributions, where each one spans a narrow range of values compared to the range spanned but the collection of distributions, it is usually a good idea to plot the cumulative distribution. This is because the individual distributions can be hard to see, but the cumulative distribution is easier to interpret.\nax = az.plot_ppc(idata, group=\"prior\", kind=\"cumulative\")\nax.axvline(50, color=\"0.5\", linestyle=\":\", lw=3, label=\"newborn\")\nax.axvline(175, color=\"0.5\", linestyle=\"--\", lw=3, label=\"adult\")\nplt.legend()",

In very general terms, this principle establishes that given two or more equivalent explanations for the same phenomenon, the simplest one is the preferred explanation. When the explanations are models, a common criterion for simplicity is the number of parameters in a model.\nAnother factor we generally need to consider when comparing models is their accuracy, that is, how good a model is at fitting the data. According to this criterion, if we have two (or more) models and one of them explains the data better than the other, then that is the preferred model.\nIntuitively, it seems that when comparing models, we tend to prefer those that fit the data best and those that are simpler. But what to do if these two principles conflict? Or more generally, is there a quantitative way to consider both contributions? The short answer is yes. In fact there is more than one way to do it.",

    "section": "6.1 Bayes factors",
    "text": "6.1 Bayes factors\nAn alternative to cross-validation, approximate cross-validation with LOO and information criteria is Bayes factors. It is common for Bayes factors to show up in the literature as a Bayesian alternative to frequentist hypothesis testing.\nWe can compare \\(K\\) models by computing their marginal likelihood, \\(p(y \\mid M_k)\\), i.e., the probability of the observed data \\(Y\\) given the model \\(M_K\\). The marginal likelihood is the normalization constant of Bayes’ theorem. We can see this if we write Bayes’ theorem and make explicit the fact that all inferences depend on the model.\n\\[\np (\\theta \\mid Y, M_k ) = \\frac{p(Y \\mid \\theta, M_k) p(\\theta \\mid M_k)}{p(Y \\mid M_k)}\n\\]\nwhere, \\(Y\\) is the data, \\(\\theta\\) is the parameters, and \\(M_K\\) is a model out of \\(K\\) competing models.\nIf our main objective is to choose only one model, the best from a set of models, we can choose the one with the largest value of \\(p(y \\mid M_k)\\). This is fine if we assume that all models have the same prior probability. Otherwise, we must calculate:\n\\[\np(M_k \\mid y) \\propto p(y \\mid M_k) p(M_k)\n\\]\nIf, instead, our main objective is to compare models to determine which are more likely and to what extent, this can be achieved using the Bayes factors:\n\\[\nBF_{01} = \\frac{p(y \\mid M_0)}{p(y \\mid M_1)}\n\\]\nThat is the ratio between the marginal likelihood of two models. The higher the value of \\(BF_{01}\\), the better the model in the numerator (\\(M_0\\) in this example). To facilitate the interpretation of the Bayes factors, and to put numbers into words, Harold Jeffreys proposed a scale for their interpretation, with levels of support or strength, see the following table.\n\n\n\nBayes Factor\nSupport\n\n\n\n\n1–3\nAnecdotal\n\n\n3–10\nModerate\n\n\n10–30\nStrong\n\n\n30–100\nVery Strong\n\n\n&gt;100\nExtreme\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that if you get numbers below 1, then the support is for \\(M_1\\), i.e., the model in the denominator. Tables are also available for those cases, but notice that you can simply take the inverse of the obtained value.\nIt is very important to remember that these rules are just conventions – simple guides at best. Results should always be put in the context of our problems and should be accompanied by enough detail so that others can assess for themselves whether they agree with our conclusions. The proof necessary to ensure something in particle physics, or in court, or to decide to carry out an evacuation in the face of a looming natural catastrophe is not the same.\n\n6.1.1 Some observations\nWe will now briefly discuss some key facts about the marginal likelihood:\n\nThe good: Occam’s razor included. Models with lots of parameters have a higher penalty than models with few parameters. The intuitive reason is that the greater the number of parameters, the more the prior extends with respect to the likelihood. An example where it is easy to see this is with nested models: for example, a polynomial of order 2 “contains” the models polynomial of order 1 and polynomial of order 0.\nThe bad: For many problems, the marginal likelihood cannot be calculated analytically. Also, approximating it numerically is usually a difficult task that in the best of cases requires specialized methods and, in the worst case, the estimates are either impractical or unreliable. In fact, the popularity of the MCMC methods is that they allow obtaining the posterior distribution without the need to calculate the marginal likelihood.\nThe ugly: The marginal likelihood depends very sensitively on the prior distribution of the parameters in each model \\(p(\\theta_k \\mid M_k)\\).\n\nIt is important to note that the good and the ugly points are related. Using marginal likelihood to compare models is a good idea because it already includes a penalty for complex models (which helps us prevent overfitting), and at the same time, a change in the prior will affect the marginal likelihood calculations. At first, this sounds a bit silly; we already know that priors affect calculations (otherwise we could just avoid them). But we are talking about changes in the prior that would have a small effect in the posterior but a great impact on the value of the marginal likelihood.\nThe use of Bayes factors is often a watershed among Bayesians. The difficulty of its calculation and the sensitivity to the priors are some of the arguments against it. Another reason is that, like p-values and hypothesis testing in general, Bayes factors favor dichotomous thinking over the estimation of the “effect size.” In other words, instead of asking ourselves questions like: How many more years of life can a cancer treatment provide? We end up asking if the difference between treating and not treating a patient is “statistically significant.” Note that this last question can be useful in some contexts. The point is that in many other contexts, this type of question is not the question that interests us; we’re only interested in the one that we were taught to answer.\n\n\n6.1.2 Calculation of Bayes factors\nThe marginal likelihood (and the Bayes factors derived from it) is generally not available in closed form, except for a few models. For this reason, many numerical methods have been devised for its calculation. Some of these methods are so simple and naive that they work very poorly in practice. We are going to discuss only one way to compute them, once that can be applied under some particular cases.\n\n\n6.1.3 Savage–Dickey ratio\nThere are times when we want to compare a null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) (or null model) against an alternative \\(H_1\\) hypothesis. For example, to answer the question “Is this coin biased?”, we could compare the value \\(\\theta = 0.5\\) (representing no bias) with the output of a model in which we allow \\(\\theta\\) to vary. For this type of comparison, the null model is nested within the alternative, which means that the null is a particular value of the model we are building. In those cases, calculating the Bayes factor is very easy and does not require any special methods. We only need to compare the prior and posterior evaluated at the null value (for example, \\(\\theta = 0.5\\)) under the alternative model. We can see that this is true from the following expression:\n\\[\nBF_{01} = \\frac{p(y \\mid H_0)}{p(y \\mid H_1)} \\frac{p(\\theta=0.5 \\mid y, H_1)}{p(\\theta=0.5 \\mid H_1)}\n\\]\nThis is true only when \\(H_0\\) is a particular case of \\(H_1\\), see.\nLet’s do it. We only need to sample the prior and posterior for a model. Let’s try the BetaBinomial model with a Uniform prior:\n\nPyMCPyStan\n\n\n\ny = np.repeat([1, 0], [50, 50])  # 50 heads, 50 tails\nwith pm.Model() as model_uni:\n    a = pm.Beta(\"a\", 1, 1)\n    yl = pm.Bernoulli(\"yl\", a, observed=y)\n    idata_uni = pm.sample(2000, random_seed=42)\n    idata_uni.extend(pm.sample_prior_predictive(8000))\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (2 chains in 2 jobs)\nNUTS: [a]\nSampling 2 chains for 1_000 tune and 2_000 draw iterations (2_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 2 seconds.\nWe recommend running at least 4 chains for robust computation of convergence diagnostics\nSampling: [a, yl]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## comming soon\n\n\n\nAnd now we call az.plot_bf\n\naz.plot_bf(idata_uni, var_name=\"a\", ref_val=0.5);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the previous Figure we can see one KDE for the prior (black) and one for the posterior (gray). The two black dots show that we evaluated both distributions at the value 0.5. We can see that the Bayes factor in favor of the null hypothesis, BF_01, is \\(\\approx 8\\), which we can interpret as moderate evidence in favor of the null hypothesis.\nAs we have already discussed, the Bayes factors measure which model, as a whole, is better at explaining the data. This includes the prior, even for models that the prior has a relatively low impact on the computation of the posterior. We can also see this prior effect by comparing a second model to the null model.\nIf, instead, our model were a BetaBinomial with a prior Beta(30, 30), the BF_01 would be lower ( on the Jeffrey scale). This is because, according to this model, the value of \\(\\theta=0.5\\) is much more likely a priori than for a Uniform prior, and therefore the prior and posterior will be much more similar. That is, it is not very to see that the posterior is concentrated around 0.5 after collecting data. Don’t just believe me, let’s calculate it:\n\nPyMCPyStan\n\n\n\nwith pm.Model() as model_conc:\n    a = pm.Beta(\"a\", 30, 30)\n    yl = pm.Bernoulli(\"yl\", a, observed=y)\n    idata_conc = pm.sample(2000, random_seed=42)\n    idata_conc.extend(pm.sample_prior_predictive(8000))\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (2 chains in 2 jobs)\nNUTS: [a]\nSampling 2 chains for 1_000 tune and 2_000 draw iterations (2_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 2 seconds.\nWe recommend running at least 4 chains for robust computation of convergence diagnostics\nSampling: [a, yl]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## comming soon\n\n\n\n\naz.plot_bf(idata_conc, var_name=\"a\", ref_val=0.5);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the BF_01 is \\(\\approx 1.6\\), which we can interpret as anecdotal evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (see the Jeffreys’ scale, discussed earlier).\n\n\n6.1.4 Bayes factors vs the alternatives\nWe could say that the Bayes factors measure which model, as a whole, is better for explaining the data. This includes the details of the prior, no matter how similar the model predictions are. In many scenarios, this is not what interests us when comparing models. For many real problems prior are not intended to be an accurate description of the True prior distribution of parameters, instead in many problems priors are choosen using some information and with the goal of providing some regulatization. In this and other cases we prefer to evaluate models in terms of how similar their predictions are. For those cases, we can use LOO.",

We indicate the number of goals scored by the home and the away team in the \\(m\\)-th match of the season (\\(M\\) matches) as \\(y_{m,h}\\) and \\(y_{m,a}\\) respectively. The model assumes the goals scored by a team follow a Poisson distribution:\n\\[y_{m,f} | \\theta_{m,f} \\sim \\text{Poiss}(\\theta_{m,f})\\]\nwhere \\(f = {h, a}\\) indicates the field, representing either home or away team. We will therefore start with a model containing two observation vectors: \\(\\mathbf{y_h} = (y_{1,h}, y_{2,h}, \\dots, y_{M,h})\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y_a} = (y_{1,a}, \\dots, y_{M,a})\\). In order to take into account each team’s scoring and defensive power and also the advantage of playing home, we will use different formulas for \\(\\theta_{m,h}\\) and for \\(\\theta_{m,a}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\theta_{m,h} &= \\alpha + home + atts_{home\\_team} + defs_{away\\_team}\\\\\n\\theta_{m,a} &= \\alpha + atts_{away\\_team} + defs_{home\\_team}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe expected number of goals score by the home team \\(\\theta_{m,h}\\) depends on an intercept (\\(\\alpha\\)), \\(home\\) to quantify the home advantage, on the attacking power of the home team and on the defensive power of the away team. Similarly, the expected number of goals score by the away team \\(\\theta_{m,a}\\) also depends on the intercept but not on the home advantage, and now, consequently, we use the attacking power of the away team and the defensive power of the home team.\nSumming up and including the priors, our base model is the following one:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\alpha &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0,5) \\qquad &\\text{scalar} \\\\\nhome &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0,5) \\qquad &\\text{scalar} \\\\\nsd_{att} &\\sim \\text{HalfStudentT}(3,2.5) \\qquad &\\text{scalar} \\\\\nsd_{def} &\\sim \\text{HalfStudentT}(3,2.5) \\qquad &\\text{scalar} \\\\\natts_* &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0,sd_{att}) \\qquad &\\text{shape (T,)} \\\\\ndefs_* &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0,sd_{def}) \\qquad &\\text{shape (T,)} \\\\\natts &= atts_* - \\text{mean}(atts_*) \\qquad &\\text{shape (T,)} \\\\\ndefs &= defs_* - \\text{mean}(defs_*) \\qquad &\\text{shape (T,)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{y}_h &\\sim \\text{Poiss}(\\theta_h) \\qquad &\\text{shape (M,)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{y}_a &\\sim \\text{Poiss}(\\theta_a) \\qquad &\\text{shape (M,)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_j\\) has been defined above.",

    "section": "7.7 Information criterion calculation",
    "text": "7.7 Information criterion calculation\nDue to the presence of the two likelihoods in our model, we cannot call az.loo or az.waic straight away because the predictive task to evaluate is ambiguous. The calculation of information criteria requires pointwise likelihood values, \\(p(y_i|\\theta)\\) with \\(y_i\\) indicating observation \\(i\\)-th and \\(\\theta\\) representing all the parameters in the model. We need to define \\(y_i\\), what does one observation represent in our model.\nAs we were introducing above, this model alone can tackle several predictive tasks. These predictive tasks can be identified by the definition of one observation which at the same time defines how are pointwise likelihood values to be calculated. Here are some examples:\n\nWe could be a group of students supporting different teams with budget to travel only to one away match of our respective teams. We may want to travel to the match where our team will score the most goals (while being the away team and also independently of the winner of the match). We will therefore assess the predictive accuracy of our model using only \\(\\mathbf{y}_a\\).\nWe could also be football fans without any clear allegiance who love an intense match between two teams of similar strength. Based on previous experience, we may consider matches that end up 3-3 or 4-4 the ones that better fit our football taste. Now we need to assess the predictive accuracy using the result of the whole match.\nEven another alternative would be wanting to be present at the match where a single team scores the most goals. In this situation, we would have to put both home and away goals in the same bag and assess the predictive accuracy on the ability to predict values from this bag, we may call the observations in this hypothetical bag “number of goals scored per match and per team”.\n\nThere are even more examples of predictive tasks where this particular model can be of use. However, it is important to keep in mind that this model predicts the number of goals scored. Its results can be used to estimate probabilities of victory and other derived quantities, but calculating the likelihood of these derived quantities may not be straighforward. And as you can see above, there isn’t one unique predictive task: it all depends on the specific question you’re interested in. As often in statistics, the answer to these questions lies outside the model, you must tell the model what to do, not the other way around.\nEven though we know that the predictive task is ambiguous, we will start trying to calculate az.loo with idata_base and then work on the examples above and a couple more to show how would this kind of tasks be performed with ArviZ. But before that, let’s see what ArviZ says when you naively ask it for the LOO of a multi-likelihood model:\n\n\nCode\naz.loo(base_idata)\n\n\nTypeError: Found several log likelihood arrays ['home_goals', 'away_goals'], var_name cannot be None\n\n\nAs expected, ArviZ has no way of knowing what predictive task we have in mind so it raises an error.\n\n7.7.1 Predicting the goals scored by the away team\nIn this particular case, we are interested in predicting the goals scored by the away team. We will still use the goals scored by the home team, but won’t take them into account when assessing the predictive accuracy. Below there is an illustration of how would cross validation be performed to assess the predictive accuracy in this particular case:\n\nThis can also be seen from a mathematical point of view. We can write the pointwise log likelihood in the following way so it defines the predictive task at hand:\n\\[ p(y_i|\\theta) = p(y_{i,h}|\\theta_{i,h}) = \\text{Poiss}(y_{i,h}; \\theta_{i,h}) \\]\nwith \\(i\\) being both the match indicator (\\(m\\), which varies with \\(i\\)) and the field indicator (\\(f\\), here always fixed at \\(h\\)). These are precisely the values stored in the home_goals of the log_likelihood group of idata_base.\nWe can tell ArviZ to use these values using the argument var_name.\n\naz.loo(base_idata, var_name=\"home_goals\")\n\nComputed from 8000 posterior samples and 380 observations log-likelihood matrix.\n\n         Estimate       SE\nelpd_loo  -568.55    12.66\np_loo       15.59        -\n------\n\nPareto k diagnostic values:\n                         Count   Pct.\n(-Inf, 0.5]   (good)      380  100.0%\n (0.5, 0.7]   (ok)          0    0.0%\n   (0.7, 1]   (bad)         0    0.0%\n   (1, Inf)   (very bad)    0    0.0%\n\n\n\naz.compare(model_dict, var_name=\"home_goals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrank\nelpd_loo\np_loo\nelpd_diff\nweight\nse\ndse\nwarning\nscale\n\n\n\n\nbudget\n0\n-567.057532\n10.716592\n0.000000\n0.715937\n13.055752\n0.000000\nFalse\nlog\n\n\nbase\n1\n-568.553182\n15.589902\n1.495650\n0.284063\n12.661187\n2.767823\nFalse\nlog\n\n\nnofield\n2\n-574.119733\n15.814319\n7.062202\n0.000000\n15.312384\n4.387979\nFalse\nlog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naz.compare(model_dict, var_name=\"away_goals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrank\nelpd_loo\np_loo\nelpd_diff\nweight\nse\ndse\nwarning\nscale\n\n\n\n\nbudget\n0\n-480.386626\n6.888639\n0.000000\n1.000000e+00\n11.546581\n0.000000\nFalse\nlog\n\n\nbase\n1\n-482.936745\n10.241680\n2.550119\n2.781109e-14\n11.831405\n1.943906\nFalse\nlog\n\n\nnofield\n2\n-488.971732\n10.193199\n8.585106\n0.000000e+00\n9.456310\n3.420849\nFalse\nlog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7.2 Predicting the outcome of a match\nAnother option is being interested in the outcome of the matches. In our current model, the outcome of a match is not who wins or the aggregate of scored goals by both teams, the outcome is the goals scored by the home team and by the away team, both quantities at the same time. Below there is an illustration on how would cross validation be used to assess the predictive accuracy in this situation:\n\nThe one observation in this situation is therefore a vector with two components: \\(y_i = (y_{i,h}, y_{i,a})\\). Like above, we also have \\(M\\) observations. The pointwise likelihood is therefore a product:\n\\[\np(y_i|\\theta) = p(y_{i,h}|\\theta_{i,h})p(y_{i,a}|\\theta_{i,a}) =\n\\text{Poiss}(y_{i,h}; \\theta_{i,h})\\text{Poiss}(y_{i,a}; \\theta_{i,a})\n\\]\nwith \\(i\\) being equal to the match indicator \\(m\\). Therefore, we have \\(M\\) observations like in the previous example, but each observation has two components.\nWe can calculate the product as a sum of logarithms and store the result in a new variable inside the log_likelihood group.\n\ndef match_lik(idata):\n    log_lik = idata.log_likelihood\n    log_lik[\"matches\"] = log_lik.home_goals + log_lik.away_goals\n    return idata\n\nbase_idata = match_lik(base_idata)\nbudget_idata = match_lik(budget_idata)\nnofield_idata = match_lik(nofield_idata)\n\naz.loo(base_idata, var_name=\"matches\")\n\nComputed from 8000 posterior samples and 380 observations log-likelihood matrix.\n\n         Estimate       SE\nelpd_loo -1051.48    16.93\np_loo       25.81        -\n------\n\nPareto k diagnostic values:\n                         Count   Pct.\n(-Inf, 0.5]   (good)      380  100.0%\n (0.5, 0.7]   (ok)          0    0.0%\n   (0.7, 1]   (bad)         0    0.0%\n   (1, Inf)   (very bad)    0    0.0%\n\n\n\naz.compare(model_dict, var_name=\"matches\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrank\nelpd_loo\np_loo\nelpd_diff\nweight\nse\ndse\nwarning\nscale\n\n\n\n\nbudget\n0\n-1047.441755\n17.606963\n0.000000\n0.84896\n17.072842\n0.000000\nFalse\nlog\n\n\nbase\n1\n-1051.475361\n25.812936\n4.033606\n0.15104\n16.927232\n3.399485\nFalse\nlog\n\n\nnofield\n2\n-1063.093483\n26.019985\n15.651728\n0.00000\n17.563750\n5.491706\nFalse\nlog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7.3 Predicting the goals scored per match and per team\nAnother example described above is being interested in the scored goals per match and per team. In this situation, our observations are a scalar once again.\n\nThe expression of the likelihood is basically the same as the one in the first example (both cases are scalars), but the difference is in the index, but that does not make it less significant:\n\\[\np(y_i|\\theta) = p(y_{i}|\\theta_{i}) =\n\\text{Poiss}(y_{i}; \\theta_{i})\n\\]\nwith \\(i\\) being both the match indicator \\(m\\) and the field indicator \\(f\\), both varying with \\(i\\). Now, we will consider \\(i\\) as an index iterating over the values in\n\\[\\big\\{(1,h), (2,h), \\dots, (M-1,h), (M,h), (1,a), (2,a) \\dots (M-1,a), (M,a)\\big\\}\\]\nTherefore, unlike in previous cases, we have \\(2M\\) observations.\nWe can obtain the pointwise log likelihood corresponding to this case by concatenating the pointwise log likelihoods of home_goals and away_goals. Then, like in the previous case, store the result in a new variable inside the log_likelihood group.\n\ndef goals_lik(idata):\n    log_lik = idata.log_likelihood\n    log_lik[\"goals\"] = xr.concat((log_lik.home_goals, log_lik.away_goals), \"match\").rename({\"match\": \"goal\"})\n    return idata\n    \nbase_idata = goals_lik(base_idata)\nbudget_idata = goals_lik(budget_idata)\nnofield_idata = goals_lik(nofield_idata)\n\naz.loo(base_idata, var_name=\"goals\")\n\nComputed from 8000 posterior samples and 760 observations log-likelihood matrix.\n\n         Estimate       SE\nelpd_loo -1051.49    17.60\np_loo       25.83        -\n------\n\nPareto k diagnostic values:\n                         Count   Pct.\n(-Inf, 0.5]   (good)      760  100.0%\n (0.5, 0.7]   (ok)          0    0.0%\n   (0.7, 1]   (bad)         0    0.0%\n   (1, Inf)   (very bad)    0    0.0%\n\n\n\naz.compare(model_dict, var_name=\"goals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrank\nelpd_loo\np_loo\nelpd_diff\nweight\nse\ndse\nwarning\nscale\n\n\n\n\nbudget\n0\n-1047.444158\n17.605232\n0.000000\n8.519505e-01\n17.710455\n0.000000\nFalse\nlog\n\n\nbase\n1\n-1051.489927\n25.831582\n4.045769\n1.480495e-01\n17.604908\n3.382467\nFalse\nlog\n\n\nnofield\n2\n-1063.091466\n26.007518\n15.647308\n9.992007e-16\n18.260083\n5.564137\nFalse\nlog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7.4 Predicting team level performance\nThe last example covered here is estimating the predictive accuracy at group level. This can be useful to assess the accuracy of predicting the whole season of a new team. In addition, this can also be used to evaluate the hierarchical part of the model.\nAlthough theoretically possible, importance sampling tends to fail at the group level due to all the observations being too informative. See this post for more details.\nIn this situation, we could describe the cross validation as excluding a team. When we exclude a team, we will exclude all the matches played by the team, not only the goals scored by the team but the whole match. Here is the illustration:\n\nIn the first column, we are excluding “Levante U.D.” which in the rows shown only appears once. In the second one, we are excluding “Athletic Club” which appears two times. This goes on following the order of appearance in the away team column.\n\ndef team_lik(idata):\n    log_lik = idata.log_likelihood\n    const = idata.constant_data\n    groupby_sum_home = log_lik.groupby(const.home_team).sum().rename({\"home_team\": \"team\"})\n    groupby_sum_away = log_lik.groupby(const.away_team).sum().rename({\"away_team\": \"team\"})\n\n    log_lik[\"teams_match\"] = (\n        groupby_sum_home.home_goals + groupby_sum_home.away_goals +\n        groupby_sum_away.home_goals + groupby_sum_away.away_goals\n    )\n    return idata\n    \nbase_idata = team_lik(base_idata)\nbudget_idata = team_lik(budget_idata)\nnofield_idata = team_lik(nofield_idata)\n\n\naz.loo(base_idata, var_name=\"teams_match\")\n\n/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.10.14/x64/lib/python3.10/site-packages/arviz/stats/stats.py:789: UserWarning: Estimated shape parameter of Pareto distribution is greater than 0.7 for one or more samples.
