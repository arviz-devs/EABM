    "# Model Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform a Bayesian analysis we need to define a model (a combination of prior and likelihood) and then apply Bayes theorem. In a magical world we should be able to define the *true* model corresponding to the *true* data generating process. In the real world, we can only hope to define a reasonable enough model to make predictions and/or explain the data. The process of finding this useful model is generally iterative and involves creating more than one candidate model. \n",
    "\n",
    "When faced with more than one model for the same data it is *natural* to ask how these models compare to each other. One way to do this is to perform posterior predictive checks as we saw in the previous chapter. Another one is to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions on new data, *i.e.* data not used to fit the model in the first place. It is generally assumed that both datasets come from the *the true generating process*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inconvenience of using new data, is that in general we can not afford the luxury of putting aside a portion of our data and not use it to fit a model. Even in a *big-data regime* we have good reasons to use all the available data, two of them are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduce the uncertainty of our estimates\n",
    "* Increase the number of questions we can ask from the data. \n",

    "##  Predictive accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, any measure of predictive accuracy should take into account the application at hand and it should include benefits and cost of the model's predictions. We discuss such an example in the \"chapter XXX Decision-theory\". In this chapter we will, instead, discuss very general methods that are applicable to a wide range of models and problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pretty common way of measuring how well a model fits the data is to compute the quadratic mean error between a data-point ($y_i$) and a pointwise prediction $\\operatorname{E} (y_i \\mid \\theta))$:\n",

    "This is the average of the quadratic differences between observed and predicted data. By taking the square we ensure that (positive and negative) errors do not cancel each other out. Also by taking the square we penalize larger deviations, compared to using for example the absolute value of the differences \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing probabilistic forecasting measures of predictive accuracy are generally known as [scoring rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule). Given a probability vector $\\mathbf{r}$ with a probability for each of the $i$ outcomes. A scoring rule will give a reward of $S({\\mathbf {r}}, i)$ if the $i$th event occurs. We say we have a proper scoring rule, if the highest expected reward is obtained by reporting the true probability distribution. A proper scoring rule is said to be local if its value depends only on the probability $r_{i}$.  It can be [shown](https://www.stat.washington.edu/raftery/Research/PDF/Gneiting2007jasa.pdf) that the logarithmic scoring rule is the only local and proper scoring rule. This is true up to an affine transformation, that is if $S(\\mathbf {r} ,i)$ is a strictly proper scoring rule then $a+b S({\\mathbf {r}},i)$ with $b>0$ is also a strictly proper scoring rule. Long story short, it is pretty common to use the log-likelihood $\\log p(y_i \\mid \\theta)$ as a measure of the point-wise predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the likelihood is Gaussian, then the average log-likelihood will be proportional to the quadratic mean error. For historical reasons people use the *deviance* scale when talking about predictive accuracy, this is simply multiplying the log-likelihood by $-2$:\n",

    "> The lower the deviance, the larger the log-likelihood and thus the greater the agreement between model's predictions and data. We want smaller values of deviance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle the more complex a model (the more parameters to tune) the lower the deviance will be. This is reflecting the intuition that a model with more parameters will be in general more flexible and thus it will fit the data better. Thus relying only on the deviance could lead us to choose models prone to [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting). Overfitting is the tendency of a model to adjust so well to the data used to fit it that it will be very bad at fitting (or generalizing) to new data. For this reason the deviance is used together with a term penalizing the over-complexity of models."

It does not use the full *a posteriori* distribution, discarding potentially useful information. On average AIC will behave worst as we increase the information in the priors, or in general the structure in our model. Thus it is not compatible with informative and weakly informative priors, neither with hierarchical models. AIC assumes that the posterior can be well represented (at least asymptotically) by a Gaussian distribution, but this is not true for a number of models, including hierarchical models, mixture models, neural networks, etc. Fortunately, we have better alternatives."

    "[Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) (CV) is another method of estimating out-of-sample prediction accuracy. This method requires re-fitting a model many times, each time excluding a portion of the data, the excluded portion is then used to measure the accuracy of them model. This process is repeated many times and the estimated accuracy of the model will be the average of each run. Then the entire dataset is used to fit the model one more time and this is the model used for further analysis and/or predictions. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) is a particular type of cross-validation when the data excluded is a single data-point. \n",
    "\n",
    "As CV can be quite time consuming (especially for Bayesian models) it is interesting to note that in theory it is possible to approximate LOO-CV. A practical and computational efficient way to do it requires using a combination of strategies that includes what is called [Pareto smoothed importance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02646). The resulting method is known as PSIS-LOO-CV which, while very useful, has a very complicated name, thus we just call it LOO. \n",
